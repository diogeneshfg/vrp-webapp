# VRP-WEBAPP
Java web interface for Vehicle (VRP) and Inventory (IRP) Routing Problems.

This interface was bulti using: 
  - Eclipse;
  - JSF 2.2; 
  - Primefaces Community 6.2;
  - Hibernate 5.2.13;   
  - JNA 4.5.2;
  - Open Street Map (OSM);
  - Open Street Routing Machine (OSRM) (https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend); 
  - Leaflet 1.3.4;
  - Mysql Server Community 5.7;
  
This interface was bulti mainly to help researchers an users in how to integrate cientific tools like the ones developed for
combinatorial optmizations problems like VRP, IRP etc. 
This is because the majority of the solution methods and models are coded in C/C++ due the hard nature of finding solutions for those problems.

# OSRM
OSRM binaries were compile by me for Windows 10. If you need it for another Operational System please go to the https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend for futher instructions.

# USE and DISTRIBUTION
Feel free to use and distribuit it as a research, open source, or free project. This project was built to help others in a way to integrate mathematical models and methods to user fiendly interfaces making these kind of decision tools avaible in an easy manner to decision makers and community.
